			<!-- Teaching Philosophy (formatted with manual line breaks for readability) -->

			<h3>💙 Empathy Comes First</h3>
			<p>
			I believe the most important part of being a good teacher is empathy.  
			A classroom should be a space where students feel safe to grow,  
			ask questions, and even fail sometimes.  

			From my own experience being both a student and a tutor,  
			I know how hard it is to learn when you're overwhelmed or confused.  
			That’s why I want to create a space where students know it’s okay  
			to be vulnerable and curious, and where they feel like they belong.
			</p>

			<h3>🤝 Building Relationships & Connection</h3>
			<p>
			I value relationships and connection in the classroom.  
			When students feel understood, they’re more likely to engage,  
			to trust, and to be open to learning.  

			That starts by really listening and  
			watching how students react during lessons,  
			being responsive when they’re stuck or frustrated,  
			and creating routines where they feel respected and heard.
			</p>

			<h3>🧩 Learning Through Projects, Inquiry & Exploration</h3>
			<p>
			My teaching style leans toward project-based, inquiry-driven learning.  
			I like to use tools like Desmos Classroom to support collaborative exploration  
			and make math and computer science interactive.  

			In particular, I apply the 5 Practices for Orchestrating  
			Mathematical Discussions to plan meaningful conversations  
			around student thinking:  
			<ol>
				<li>anticipate what students might try,</li>
				<li>monitor their work in real time,</li>
				<li>select key examples,</li>
				<li>sequence them in a purposeful way, and</li>
				<li>connect ideas together.</li>
			</ol>

			This helps students not just “get the right answer,”  
			but understand why things work and gain confidence  
			in sharing their thinking with others.
			</p>

			<h3>📈 Assessment as Growth, Not Just Grades</h3>
			<p>
			When it comes to assessment,  
			I don’t think grades should be the only story.  

			I try to focus more on effort, progress,  
			and how students reflect on their learning.  

			I use things like formative check-ins, exit tickets,  
			peer feedback, and spaced review activities.  

			That helps me understand where students are,  
			and it helps them become more self-aware  
			about how they’re growing.  

			I also try to make sure my assessments are accessible and fair  
			offering multiple ways to show understanding  
			and being flexible when life gets in the way.
			</p>

			<h3>🌱 Supporting Diverse Learners & Making STEM Inclusive</h3>
			<p>
			Supporting diverse learners is a priority.  
			I want every student to feel seen and valued

			whether that means adjusting pacing,  
			offering visual supports,  
			or encouraging them to try again after a mistake.  

			I believe in individualized learning that allows students  
			to work at the level that challenges but doesn’t overwhelm them.  

			I’m especially passionate about increasing representation in STEM  
			by encouraging students from all backgrounds 
			to see themselves as capable creators, designers, and problem-solvers.
			</p>

			<h3>🧘 Classroom Management with Structure & Compassion</h3>
			<p>
			I know that good classroom management isn’t about being strict  
			it’s about creating structure, consistency, and clear expectations.  

			I want to build an environment where students know what to expect  
			and feel safe to make mistakes.  

			When behavior issues come up,  
			I try to understand the “why” behind it  
			whether it’s stress, disconnection, or uncertainty  
			and approach it with patience and restoration,  
			not fear or punishment.
			</p>

			<h3>✨ Teaching with Faith, Purpose, and Joy</h3>
			<p>
			Lastly, teaching isn’t just about academics for me  
			it’s also spiritual.  

			I believe in building a classroom that reflects  
			patience, kindness, forgiveness, and compassion.  

			I want students to see that math and computer science  
			aren’t just tools for a career  
			they’re also windows into the order, beauty,  
			and creativity of God’s world.  

			My goal is to nurture meaningful relationships  
			between students, teachers, and God,  
			and to help students recognize their purpose and gifts  
			both in the classroom and beyond.
			</p>
