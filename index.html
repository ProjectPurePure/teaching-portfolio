            <h3>💙 Empathy Comes First</h3>
            <p>
                I believe the most important part of being a good teacher is empathy. A
                classroom should be a space where students feel safe to grow, ask
                questions, and even fail sometimes. From my own experience being both a
                student and a tutor, I know how hard it is to learn when you're
                overwhelmed or confused. That’s why I want to create a space where
                students know it’s okay to be vulnerable and curious, and where they
                feel like they belong.
            </p>

            <h3>🤝 Building Relationships & Connection</h3>
            <p>
                I value relationships and connection in the classroom. When students
                feel understood, they’re more likely to engage, to trust, and to be open
                to learning. That starts by really listening and watching how students
                react during lessons, being responsive when they’re stuck or frustrated,
                and creating routines where they feel respected and heard.
            </p>

            <h3>🧩 Learning Through Projects, Inquiry & Exploration</h3>
            <p>
                My teaching style leans toward project-based, inquiry-driven learning. I
                like to use tools like Desmos Classroom to support collaborative
                exploration and make math and computer science interactive. In
                particular, I apply the 5 Practices for Orchestrating Mathematical
                Discussions to plan meaningful conversations around student thinking:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>anticipate what students might try,</li>
                <li>monitor their work in real time,</li>
                <li>select key examples,</li>
                <li>sequence them in a purposeful way, and</li>
                <li>connect ideas together.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                This helps students not just “get the right answer,” but understand why
                things work and gain confidence in sharing their thinking with others.
            </p>

            <h3>📈 Assessment as Growth, Not Just Grades</h3>
            <p>
                When it comes to assessment, I don’t think grades should be the only
                story. I try to focus more on effort, progress, and how students reflect
                on their learning. I use things like formative check-ins, exit tickets,
                peer feedback, and spaced review activities. That helps me understand
                where students are, and it helps them become more self-aware about how
                they’re growing. I also try to make sure my assessments are accessible
                and fair offering multiple ways to show understanding and being flexible
                when life gets in the way.
            </p>

            <h3>🌱 Supporting Diverse Learners & Making STEM Inclusive</h3>
            <p>
                Supporting diverse learners is a priority. I want every student to feel
                seen and valued whether that means adjusting pacing, offering visual
                supports, or encouraging them to try again after a mistake. I believe in
                individualized learning that allows students to work at the level that
                challenges but doesn’t overwhelm them. I’m especially passionate about
                increasing representation in STEM by encouraging students from all
                backgrounds to see themselves as capable creators, designers, and
                problem-solvers.
            </p>

            <h3>🧘 Classroom Management with Structure & Compassion</h3>
            <p>
                I know that good classroom management isn’t about being strict it’s
                about creating structure, consistency, and clear expectations. I want to
                build an environment where students know what to expect and feel safe to
                make mistakes. When behavior issues come up, I try to understand the
                “why” behind it whether it’s stress, disconnection, or uncertainty and
                approach it with patience and restoration, not fear or punishment.
            </p>

            <h3>✨ Teaching with Faith, Purpose, and Joy</h3>
            <p>
                Lastly, teaching isn’t just about academics for me it’s also spiritual.
                I believe in building a classroom that reflects patience, kindness,
                forgiveness, and compassion. I want students to see that math and
                computer science aren’t just tools for a career they’re also windows
                into the order, beauty, and creativity of God’s world. My goal is to
                nurture meaningful relationships between students, teachers, and God,
                and to help students recognize their purpose and gifts both in the
                classroom and beyond.
